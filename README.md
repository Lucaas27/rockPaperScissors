## Description

JavaScript Project part of The Odin Project curriculum. [Part One](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/rock-paper-scissors) and [Part Two](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/dom-manipulation#practice)

I decided to use this project to put all my current knowledge to practice - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript(DOM manipulation). I had to re-work my HTML structure a couple times, until I was satisfied with the design of the page. The functionality that I created with javascript was added bit by bit.

I had a bit of a struggle figuring out how to remove a css transition that I added for a 'click' event. After researching I was able to figure it out. I added an event listener for 'transitionend', which would remove the css class.

## Features
